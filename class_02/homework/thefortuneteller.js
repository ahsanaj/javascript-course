// The Fortune Teller
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title. Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var childrenCount = 4;
var partnerName = "Jennifer Lawrence";
var geoLocation = "Antarctica";
var jobTitle = "Banana Ripener";

//Concatenate all the strings together

var fortune = "You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geoLocation + ", and married to " + partnerName + " with " + childrenCount + " kids."

//Output fortune to the screen
console.log(fortune);
